He was already listed as questionable heading into the game and was only able to get on the court for 13 minutes before the spasms flared up. Matt Ryan and Taurean Prince will see more opportunities while Anderson is out, and fantasy managers should monitor Anderson's status heading into this coming week to decide on streaming options.",

        "Content": "Washington Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma (ankle) was injured during Saturday's loss to the Brooklyn Nets. The 27-year-old tweaked his left ankle in the second quarter and didn't return, ending his night after only 11 minutes of work. Kuzma has played well this season, averaging a career-high 21.6 points along with 7.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists. With the Wizards hosting the Cavaliers on Monday, there's a chance he won't be on the floor. If that's the case, Deni Avdija, who's averaged 8.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.9 assists in 30 starts this season, is the favorite to take Kuzma's spot in the starting lineup if he doesn't suit up.",

Saric has averaged 8.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and shot 47.1% in 11 starts this season, so there is certainly something there for fantasy managers in deeper formats. However, he'll likely split time with Torrey Craig, who should also be productive with Johnson out of the lineup.",
